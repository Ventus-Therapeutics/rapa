# 1. Overview
RAPA (Rotamer And Protonation Assignment) is a command line tool that aids in protein preparation by assigning various protonation and rotamer states of unassigned amino-acids of the given structure and outputs all the models that are energetically accessible. Details of the algorithm can be found in the following manuscript:

# 2. Getting started

Minimum of Python 3.6 is required.

## Installation
1. Download or git clone using: https://github.com/Ventus-Therapeutics/rapa.git
2. Run:  ``` pip install -r requirement.txt ``` or ``` conda install --yes --file requirement.txt ``` to install the dependencies.


## Usage
### Preparing Files for RAPA (not supported by this repository)
#### RAPA requires that the input PDB file meets the following criteria
1. **No gaps** – Protein structure must be contiguous. There must be no missing residues or missing atoms.  
2. **No steric clashes** – The structure must not contain steric clashes.  
3. **No hydrogen atoms** – The PDB file must not contain hydrogen atoms.  
4. **AMBER format** – All residue names must follow the AMBER format.

### Running RAPA  

#### Basic Usage  
RAPA is executed with a PDB file as input. For instance, to run RAPA on the PDB file `1xl2_noH.pdb` ( **having no gaps, no steric clashes, no hydrogen atoms and has all residue names in AMBER format**) in the examples folder, the following steps can be executed:
``` bash
$cd <path to rapa folder>/examples/
$<path to rapa folder>/src/rapa.py -pID [input_pdb_name.pdb] -o [out_name]   
$<path to rapa folder>/src/rapa.py -pID '1xl2_noH.pdb' -o '1xl2_out'  
```
##### Notes
1. The provided PDBs in the example folder have **no gaps, no steric clashes, no hydrogen atoms and has all residue names in AMBER format**, hence meeting the conditions to run RAPA on it.

#### Command-Line Arguments  

##### `-pID` or `--protein_id` (Required)  
- **Type:** String  
- **Description:** Specifies the input PDB file name. RAPA **will not run** without this argument.  
- **Example:**  
  ```bash 
  $cd <path to rapa folder>/examples/
  $<path to rapa folder>/src/rapa.py -pID '1bcd_noH.pdb'  
  ```

##### `-o` or `--out_name` (Optional)  
- **Type:** String  
- **Default:** `[pID]_out`  
- **Description:** Defines the prefix for the output PDB files.  
- **Example:**  
  ```bash  
  $cd <path to rapa folder>/examples/
  $<path to rapa folder>/src/rapa.py -pID '1bcd_noH.pdb' -o '1bcd_o'  
  ```  
  This will generate output files: `1bcd_o_0.pdb`, `1bcd_o_1.pdb`, etc.  
  If omitted, RAPA defaults to `1bcd_noH_out_0.pdb`, `1bcd_noH_out_1.pdb`, etc.  

Since `-o` is optional, the following command will also run RAPA:  
```bash  
$cd <path to rapa folder>/examples/
$<path to rapa folder>/src/rapa.py -pID '1xl2_noH.pdb'  
```

##### Listing Available Options  
Use the `-h` flag to view all available command-line options:  
```bash  
$<path to rapa folder>/src/rapa.py -h  
```

# 3. Files and Folders Generated by RAPA  

## 1. `[input_pdb_name]_HLPsp2.pdb`  
- Created for each input PDB.  
- Contains sp2 hydrogen and lone pair coordinates computed and added.  

## 2. `outputs_[input_pdb_name]` (Output Folder)  
This folder contains all output files generated by RAPA.  

### 2.1 `[input_pdb_name].info` (Run Information File)  
This file contains:  
- **Basic information:**  
  - PDB file name, ID, number of models, and chains.  
- **Residue and atom details:**  
  - Lists ASP/GLU residues investigated by RAPA.  
  - Displays unresolved ASP/GLU residues with their residue numbers, atom IDs, and distance details.  
      - If more than 2 ASP/GLU residues are within hydrogen bonding distance, RAPA does **not** resolve them. Manual intervention is required.  
- **Run summary:**  
  - Execution time.  
  - Number of output PDB files produced.  
  - File path of generated outputs.  

### 2.2 `pdb_out_[input_pdb_name]` (PDB Output Folder)  
Contains all PDB output files generated by RAPA.

# 4. Example Runs  
Example PDB files are available in the `examples` folder.
