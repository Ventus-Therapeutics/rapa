The PDB ID being used: 3f07_0 and start time is: 43557156.991580196

The structure has number of models 1: [<Model id=0>] and number of chains: 1: [<Chain id=A>]

Collected atoms for chain: <Chain id=A> and now I will fix backbone H 
Writing file at: 3f07_0_HLPsp2.pdb  
After adding the hydrogens..
